However, researchers have found marked differences between the two drugs. One of the factors that leads to addiction and drug abuse is how quickly a drug raises dopamine levels. The faster dopamine levels go up, the greater the potential for abuse. One researcher found that Ritalin takes about an hour to raise dopamine levels in the brain, compared to only seconds with inhaled cocaine. The doses of Ritalin and other stimulants used to treat ADHD tend to be lower and longer-acting, which reduces the risk of addiction. Long-term use of all stimulants can sometimes lead to a phenomenon called tolerance -- that is, higher doses are needed to achieve the same effect of a controlled substance. If and when this happens, a doctor may then be more likely to consider using nonstimulant medicines to treat ADHD."

These are neurotransmitters in your brain that calm and relax you so you can focus better. They also affect sleep in different ways. That may be the reason the drug causes drowsiness in some but not others. In studies, 2% to 4% of kids who took the drug had low energy and sleepiness. For adults, it was 6%."

            "How can I make my own saline solution for a neti pot?": "To make your own saline mixture, mix 3 teaspoons of salt with 1 teaspoon of baking soda and store in a sterile airtight container. To use, combine about 8 ounces of lukewarm water (distilled, sterile or previously boiled) with 1 teaspoon of the mixture. Be sure to use canning or pickling salt that has no preservatives, iodide, or other additives that can irritate your sinuses.\nPut the mixture into a clean Neti pot. Tilt your head over your sink at a 45-degree angle. Place the spout into your top nostril and gently pour the solution in. The saline water will flow through your nasal cavity into the other nostril and out. Blow your nose to get rid of remaining water. Repeat the steps on your other nostril."

To find out what\u2019s going on, they'll:\nAsk you about your family history. Much like allergies, alcohol intolerance can be passed down in families.\nAsk you about your symptoms and give you a physical exam\nDo a skin prick test. It can show if you're allergic to an ingredient in alcoholic beverages. You\u2019ll get a prick on your skin with a tiny bit of the substance you may be allergic to. If you're allergic, you\u2019ll get a raised bump in that spot.\nTest your blood\nYour doctor also may recommend that you stop drinking all alcoholic beverages for a while. Then you can start again, perhaps trying just one of your go-to drinks at a time."

The goal is to teach your baby how to sleep on their own and put themselves back to sleep if they wake up during the night. Richard Ferber, MD, director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital Boston, developed this method. He advises parents not to start this training until their baby is at least 5 or 6 months old. Here\u2019s an overview of how it\u2019s done:\nPut your baby in their crib -- drowsy, but awake. Once you've finished their bedtime routine, leave the room.\nIf your baby cries, wait a few minutes before you check on them. The amount of time you wait depends on you and your baby. You might start waiting somewhere between 1 and 5 minutes.\nWhen you re-enter your baby\u2019s room, try to console them. But do not pick them up and do not stay for more than 2-3 minutes, even if they are still crying when you leave. Seeing your face will be enough to assure your baby you're close by so they can eventually fall asleep on their own.\nIf they continue crying, gradually increase the amount of time you wait before going in to check on them again. For instance, if you wait 3 minutes the first time, wait 5 minutes the second time, and 10 minutes each time after that.\nThe next night, wait 5 minutes the first time, 10 minutes the second time, and 12 minutes each time after that.\nAdopting this method might be difficult during the first few nights. But you\u2019ll likely see improvement in your baby's sleep pattern by day 3 or 4. Most parents see an improvement within a week."

The abuse is possibly an attempt to self-medicate or to treat their disturbing mood symptoms, and they may also cause mood symptoms that can mimic those of bipolar disorder. Alcohol is a depressant. That's why many people use it as a tranquilizer at the end of a hard day or as an assist for tense social situations. While some patients stop drinking when they are depressed, it is more common that someone with bipolar disorder drinks during low moods. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, people with bipolar disorder are five times more likely to develop alcohol misuse and dependence than the rest of the population."

Your doctor gives you a shot of progestin you get in your arm or rear end every 3 months. It prevents pregnancy by thickening mucus in your cervix that keeps sperm out of your uterus and by preventing ovulation.\nPatch. You wear a patch that releases progestin and estrogen into your bloodstream. Together these hormones thicken mucus in your cervix, stop ovulation, and change the lining of your uterus so a pregnancy won\u2019t develop. You\u2019ll put a new one on every week for 3 weeks. When you take the last one off at the start of the 4th week, you\u2019ll have your period. You won\u2019t wear a patch that week.\nRing: You put this ring into your vagina.

Malignant primary brain tumors are cancers that originate in the brain, typically grow faster than benign tumors, and aggressively invade surrounding tissue. Although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs, it can spread to other parts of the brain and central nervous system. Benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually are not deeply rooted in brain tissue. This makes them easier to surgically remove, assuming they are in an area of the brain that can be safely operated on. But even after they've been removed, they can still come back, although benign tumors are less likely to recur than malignant ones."

Arteries and veins in the brain grow in a tangle and become connected by tube-like structures called fistulae. These arteries are not as strong as normal arteries. The veins are often enlarged because of the constant flow of blood directly from the arteries through the fistulae to the veins. These fragile vessels may rupture, leaking blood into the brain. In addition, the brain tissue may not receive enough blood to function properly. Damage to the brain may cause seizures -- the first symptoms of an AVM."

When doctors find an area in your breast that isn\u2019t normal, they\u2019ll cut out a little bit of the tissue to test the cells. This is called a biopsy. A doctor called a pathologist will look at your biopsied tissue under a microscope. The structure will tell him or her if the cells are normal, precancerous, or cancerous. If it\u2019s cancer, the doctor will do more tests to figure out the exact kind. If your cells don\u2019t test positive for estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors, then it\u2019s triple-negative.

A CDK 4/6 inhibitor such as abemacicib (Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance) or ribociclb (Kisqali) is sometimes given in postmenopausal women with certain types of advanced breast cancer. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) and toremifene (Fareston) block hormone receptors and are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. These medications can stop this protein from making the cancer grow and can make chemotherapy more effective. Those who are HER2-negative but have BRCA-mutated breast cancer could be treated by a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors that target a protein that helps cancer cells grow. PARP inhibitors include olaparib (Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna). Everolimus (Afinitor) is a targeted therapy sometimes given to women with HER2-negative breast cancer along with the hormone therapy exemestane (Aromasin).\nPatients who are HER2-negative but have PIK3CA-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer could be treated by the new PIK3 inhibitor alpelisib (Piqray) in combination with fulvestrant."

Most cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), not genetic mutations.\nDoctors do think, however, that cervical cancer may run in some families. So if you have it, your daughter is 2 to 3 times more likely to have it than someone whose mother did not.

Staging classifies the cancer by how much is in your body and where it has spread when it\u2019s diagnosed. Knowing the stage can help your medical team plan the right treatment for you.\nThe stages of cervical cancer are:\nStage 0. Cancer is only on the surface of the cervix and have not grown into deeper tissues.\nStage I. The cancer has grown into the cervix, but it hasn't spread to lymph nodes or other organs.\nStage II. The cancer has spread outside of the cervix and uterus. It may have reached the upper part of the vagina.\nStage III. The cancer has spread to the lower part of the vagina or the walls of the pelvis. It has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nStage IV. This is the most advanced stage. The cancer has spread to other parts of the body, like the bladder, rectum, lungs, or liver.\nYour stage of a cancer won\u2019t be changed if your cancer gets worse or comes back. Your doctor will always refer to it by the stage it was when it was diagnosed."

High levels put you at risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke.\nTypical fasting time: 9-12 hours\nBasic or comprehensive metabolic panel is often part of a routine physical. The tests check your blood sugar, electrolyte and fluid balance, and kidney function. The comprehensive test checks your liver function, too.\nTypical fasting time: 10-12 hours\nVitamin B12 test measures how much of the vitamin is in your blood. It can help diagnosis a specific type of anemia and other problems. Some medications can interfere with this test. Tell your doctor about all the drugs you take.\nTypical fasting time: 6-8 hours\nIron tests are used to see if iron levels in your system are too low or too high.\nTypical fasting time: 12 hours\nGamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) shows the level of the GGT enzyme in your system. A high reading may indicate liver disease, bile duct problems, or alcohol abuse.\nYour doctor may ask you to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand.

A colon stricture slows or stops waste from passing through.\nSome signs of strictures can feel vague. Other times, the symptoms may be more obvious. Your colon\u2019s job is to process the digested food and liquids and push the waste down to your rectum to be eliminated as stool. A serious stricture can block your bowels and make it hard for you to poop.\nSymptoms of a colon stricture may include if you:\nAre nauseated or feel sick to your stomach\nThrow up\nHave stomach cramping, pain, or bloating\nAre constipated\nHave diarrhea\nNotice swelling\nLose your appetite\nFeel tired\nIf you don't treat it early, a stricture can turn deadly."

They slow or stop waste from passing through.\nLifestyle changes, medicine, and surgery are the three main ways to treat strictures. Your doctor will recommend a treatment plan tailored to your needs:\nChanges to your diet. A low-fiber or low-residue diet reduces the risk of blocks in your intestine and the number and size of your poops. Studies also show a connection between a gluten-free diet and relief of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which could lower your risk of strictures.\nAnti-TNF treatment. This medicine eases inflammation from a protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and prevents new strictures from forming. It only works on strictures related to inflammation, not fibrosis.\nColonoscopy. Doctors widen the colon with a balloon inserted through a flexible tube (endoscope). They may use a stent to keep the narrowed area open.\nYour doctor may also suggest surgery. Studies show that most people with Crohn's disease who also have a stricture will need at least one surgery at some point. There are two kinds:\nStrictureplasty widens the narrow part of your intestine without removing it. This surgery is most helpful in the lower part of your small intestine.\nSmall bowel resection is when the surgeon takes out the damaged part of your intestine, then joins the healthy sections together. You'll have this surgery if the damage is more severe, or if doctors find that widening the intestine won't work."

A colon stricture slows or stops that waste from passing through.\nStrictures can happen in different parts of your body. They include the tube that carries food to your stomach (esophagus) and your urethra, which channels pee out of your body.\nNo matter the location, strictures come in two types. You could have one or the other, or both.\nInflammatory strictures result from swelling in your digestive tract.

So, to make a diagnosis of Crohn's, you'll probably go through a combination of exams, lab tests, and imaging studies to rule out other health problems that have similar symptoms and determine which part of your digestive tract is affected. Lab tests check for signs of infection, inflammation, internal bleeding, and low levels of substances such as iron, protein, or minerals.

With a focal seizure, abnormal electrical activity happens in only part of the brain. Focal seizures can cause unusual movements in one limb or one side of the body. Sometimes they last only a couple of seconds. They may start as focal and then become generalized. A psychomotor seizure involves strange behavior that only lasts a couple of minutes. Your dog may suddenly start attacking an imaginary object or chasing its tail. It can be tricky to tell psychomotor seizures from odd behavior, but a dog that has them will always do the same thing every time it has a seizure. Seizures from unknown causes are called idiopathic epilepsy. They usually happen in dogs between 6 months and 6 years old.

Children get more ear infections than adults because their bodies are still developing.\nIn kids, the parts of the ear that drain fluid, the Eustachian tubes, are smaller and almost level to the ground. That means they don't drain as well even when a young one is healthy.\nWhen the Eustachian tubes swell or fill with mucus, perhaps during a cold, it's even worse. It creates just the right conditions for bacteria to thrive, which can lead to infection. And for some kids, it just happens more often."

This typically means removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and might also include lymph nodes in the area.\nA lab will usually test the tissue the surgeon removes to help figure out the type of cancer and how far it may have spread.

That's because wherever the endometrial tissue develops, it often bleeds along with the lining of your uterus during your monthly period. Blood can build up in the area and cause swelling and pain. This can even scar some of your internal tissue, making it less healthy and flexible and causing still more pain.\nOther symptoms of endometriosis include painful menstrual cramps in your lower belly or back. You also might have pain during sex or pain when you urinate or have a bowel movement. You could have difficulty getting pregnant or get heavy bleeding, spotting, or bloody urine between periods.\nYou might notice similar symptoms if you have endometrial cancer. Unusual bleeding, for example, whether during or between periods, is common in about 90% of women with the disease. Unusual belly pain and swelling are more common in later stages of this cancer."

They can cause both physical and emotional effects and make you feel, see, or hear things that aren\u2019t there. About 60% of people with epilepsy have this type of seizure, which is sometimes called a partial seizure. Sometimes, the symptoms of a focal seizure can be mistaken for signs of mental illness or another kind of nerve disorder.\nGeneralized seizures: These happen when nerve cells on both sides of your brain misfire. They can make you have muscle spasms, black out, or fall."

            "How do you test for genital herpes?": "If you're having an outbreak, a doctor can swab the sores to check for the herpes virus. The sooner after an outbreak starts, the better the chances of the test being accurate.\nThe more common way to find out whether you've got the virus is through blood tests. They show whether you've been exposed to herpes and whether it's type 1 or type 2. Blood samples look for antibodies your immune system makes against the herpes virus. A positive test for HSV-2 probably means that you have the infection."

            "Will I pass genital herpes to my baby?": "Pregnant women with genital herpes should be careful -- but not overly worried -- about passing the virus on to the baby.\nA mother can infect their baby during delivery, often fatally. But if a woman had genital herpes before getting pregnant, or if they are first infected early in pregnancy, the chance that their baby will be infected is very low -- less than 1%. Women with genital herpes are examined carefully for any symptoms before giving bith. If sores or signs that an outbreak is coming show up at the time of delivery, the baby may be delivered by cesarean section (also called a C-section).\nThe risk of infecting the baby is high (30% to 50%) when a woman is newly infected late in pregnancy, however. That's because the mother's immune system has not developed protective antibodies against the virus. Women with an older herpes infection have antibodies against the virus, which help protect the baby. If you are pregnant and think you may have been infected recently, tell your doctor right away."

            "Is there a test for genital herpes?": "Yes. A doctor can take a sample from what appears to be a herpes sore and send it to a lab to be examined. You can also get a blood test that looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system made when you were infected. HSV-2, the virus that causes genital herpes, almost always infects the genitals, so if you have those antibodies you probably have genital herpes.\nA blood test that shows antibodies to HSV-1, the virus that causes cold sores, could mean genital or oral herpes. That's because oral herpes, typically caused by HSV-1, can be spread to the genitals during oral sex."

A latex condom can only protect you if it covers the infected area. But you can still get genital herpes if you receive oral sex (fellatio, cunnilingus, analingus) from someone with a cold sore on their mouth. You can also get it from someone's genitals if you give them oral sex.\nIf you know your partner has genital herpes, have sex (of any type) only when they have no symptoms.

Using a water-based lubricant can help reduce irritation. Don't use one that contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9, however. Nonoxynol-9 can irritate mucous membranes, such as the lining of the vagina. Oil-based lubricants are a no-no, too. They weaken latex, making condoms more likely to break.

            "What causes gray hair?": "Scientists have put a lot of effort into investigating the cause of gray hair, and they believe they've gotten to the root of the problem. Hair gets its color from a pigment called melanin, which is produced by melanocyte cells in the hair follicles.\nResearchers have discovered that melanocytes endure cumulative damage over the years, which eventually leaves them unable to produce melanin. Studies have cited DNA damage and a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in the follicles as possible causes of this disruption in melanin production. Without melanin, the new hair that grows in has no pigment, which makes it appear gray, white, or silver.\nSome people start to go gray young -- as early as their teens. When graying begins usually is determined by genes, so if your mother or father became gray early, you may, too"

            "How is a hair transplant done?": "You usually have the procedure in the doctor's office. First, the surgeon cleans your scalp and injects medicine to numb the back of your head. Your doctor will choose one of two methods for the transplant: follicular unit strip surgery (FUSS) or follicular unit extraction (FUE). With FUSS, the surgeon removes a 6- to 10-inch strip of skin from the back of your head. They set it aside and sews the scalp closed. This area is immediately hidden by the hair around it. Next, the surgeon\u2019s team divides the strip of removed scalp into 500 to 2,000 tiny grafts, each with an individual hair or just a few hairs. The number and type of graft you get depends on your hair type, quality, color, and the size of the area where you\u2019re getting the transplant. If you\u2019re getting the FUE procedure, the surgeon\u2019s team will shave the back of your scalp. Then, the doctor will remove hair follicles one by one from there. The area heals with small dots, which your existing hair will cover. After that point, both procedures are the same. After they prepare the grafts, the surgeon cleans and numbs the area where the hair will go, creates holes or slits with a scalpel or needle, and delicately places each graft in one of the holes. The surgeon will probably get help from other team members to plant the grafts, too."

Your surgeon will have you wear bandages over your scalp for at least a day or two, and may prescribe an antibiotic or an anti-inflammatory drug for you to take for several days. Most people can return to work two to five days after the operation. Within two to three weeks after surgery, the transplanted hair will fall out, but you should start to see new growth within a few months. Some surgeons prescribe the drug minoxidil to improve hair growth after transplantation, but it\u2019s not clear how well it works."

The goal is to teach your baby how to sleep on their own and put themselves back to sleep if they wake up during the night. Richard Ferber, MD, director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital Boston, developed this method. He advises parents not to start this training until their baby is at least 5 or 6 months old. Here\u2019s an overview of how it\u2019s done:\nPut your baby in their crib -- drowsy, but awake. Once you've finished their bedtime routine, leave the room.\nIf your baby cries, wait a few minutes before you check on them. The amount of time you wait depends on you and your baby. You might start waiting somewhere between 1 and 5 minutes.\nWhen you re-enter your baby\u2019s room, try to console them. But do not pick them up and do not stay for more than 2-3 minutes, even if they are still crying when you leave. Seeing your face will be enough to assure your baby you're close by so they can eventually fall asleep on their own.\nIf they continue crying, gradually increase the amount of time you wait before going in to check on them again. For instance, if you wait 3 minutes the first time, wait 5 minutes the second time, and 10 minutes each time after that.\nThe next night, wait 5 minutes the first time, 10 minutes the second time, and 12 minutes each time after that.\nAdopting this method might be difficult during the first few nights. But you\u2019ll likely see improvement in your baby's sleep pattern by day 3 or 4. Most parents see an improvement within a week."

            "What is the role of hiatal hernia in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)?": "Some doctors believe a hiatal hernia may weaken the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and increase the risk for gastroesophageal reflux. Hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach moves up into the chest through a small opening in the diaphragm. (The diaphragm is the muscle separating the abdomen from the chest.) Recent studies show that the opening in the diaphragm helps support the lower end of the esophagus. Many people with a hiatal hernia will not have problems with heartburn or reflux, but having a hiatal hernia may allow stomach contents to reflux more easily into the esophagus.\nCoughing, vomiting, straining, or sudden physical exertion can cause increased pressure in the abdomen, resulting in hiatal hernia. Obesity and pregnancy also contribute to this condition. Many otherwise healthy people age 50 and over have a small hiatal hernia. Although considered a condition of middle age, hiatal hernias affect people of all ages.\nHiatal hernias usually do not require treatment. However, treatment may be necessary if the hernia is in danger of becoming strangulated (twisted in a way that cuts off blood supply) or is complicated by severe GERD or esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus). The doctor may perform surgery to reduce the size of the hernia or to prevent strangulation."

The device helps reflux by preventing stomach content from backing up into the esophagus.\nAnother surgical procedure called fundoplication creates an artificial valve using the top of your stomach. The procedure involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to strengthen it.\nTalk to your doctor to find out if one of these procedures is for you."

However, in the long run high blood pressure can kill you. Normally, your heart beats regularly, pumping blood through the vessels all over your body. As the blood is pushed by the heartbeat, the blood in turn pushes against the sides of your blood vessels. Blood vessels are flexible and can widen or constrict as needed to keep blood flowing well. For a variety of reasons, your blood may begin to push too hard against the blood vessels. This is high blood pressure, which can cause your arteries to become stiff over time. This is how problems begin. High blood pressure can lead to damage of your blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and other organs in your body. Heart disease and stroke, both caused by high blood pressure, are the first and fifth leading causes of death in the U.S. The scary thing about high blood pressure is that you may have it without even knowing it.

In water, such as a warm bath or hot tub, they'll likely live longer because they thrive in warm, wet places. But the odds that sperm in a tub of water will find their way inside a woman's body and cause them to get pregnant are extremely low."

Regular exercise effectively lowers stress, as do yoga and meditation. You can also ease pressure through simple activities such as getting a massage, listening to music, taking a bath, or even reading a good book.\nAnother stress-busting technique is behavioral therapy. This approach teaches you how to change the way your mind and body react to events. It can include cognitive behavioral therapy, psychotherapy, hypnosis, biofeedback, and relaxation therapy. Most of these therapies help people avoid overreacting to stressful situations and people. The American College of Gastroenterologists says behavioral therapy can work well for many IBS symptoms."

            "How do estrogen and progesterone affect irritable bowel syndrome?": "Estrogen and progesterone affect irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in a few ways, from how your intestines work to how much pain you feel. Cells in your gut have things called receptors that let these hormones latch on to them. This suggests that your digestive system is designed to sense and react to them. Here are the main ways they affect IBS:\nDigestion: They control the smooth muscle in your intestines, which dictates how quickly food travels through your system. In one study, animals took longer to empty their intestines when they received a low dose of the hormones than when they got a higher one. This may explain why low levels of sex hormones can lead to constipation.\nPain level: These hormones affect how much your cramps bother you. A dip lowers your pain threshold, in part because estrogen boosts the production of serotonin, a feel-good chemical in your brain. A jump in estrogen can reduce some of the ouch factor, so your bellyaches or cramps don\u2019t hurt as much.\nInflammation: Sex hormones can raise levels of inflammation throughout your body. That makes your IBS symptoms worse.\nMost research has linked estrogen and progesterone with IBS. But scientists have also found that male sex hormones, like testosterone, may protect against the condition. This may be partly why men are less likely to get the disorder."

The difference is that Crohn's can affect different parts of your digestive tract.\nBesides stomach symptoms, if you have Crohn's you may feel tired all the time and lose weight. If your child has the disease, it can affect their growth and development.\nCrohn's tends to run in families. If someone you're related to has it, the odds go up that you'll have it, too."

            "What prescription medication is available for IBS-D?": "There are several options your doctor can prescribe.\nAnticholinergic dicyclomine (Bentyl) slows bowel contractions that lead to diarrhea. Hyoscyamine (Levsin) acts in much the same way.\nAn antidepressant may be an option if your irritable bowel syndrome with excessive diarrhea (IBS-D) causes a lot of pain or if you\u2019re feeling depression or anxiety. Low doses of antidepressants may block pain signals to the brain.\nAnti-anxiety drugs may work if you feel anxious right before your symptoms come on. Your doctor may suggest medicines like clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) to calm you down. They\u2019re usually only given for a short time since they have a higher risk of addiction.\nAlosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is specifically for women with IBS who are not having success with other treatments. It can help relieve stomach pain and diarrhea, but there are potentially serious side effects.\nEluxadoline (Viberzi) may help reduce bowel contractions, belly cramps, and diarrhea. It\u2019s also important to note that this is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance. This means, among other things, that you\u2019ll have to have a new prescription from your doctor each time you need it.\nRifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic that can decrease bacterial overgrowth and diarrhea. You take it for 2 weeks at a time. The treatment can be repeated up to two times if the symptoms come back."

An overload of ointment can keep skin from getting air, which will help it heal.\nSoaking in plain old warm water can work wonders, too. Fill your bathtub with a few inches of lukewarm water and sit for about 10 minutes, a few times a day. (Don\u2019t stay for too long -- oversoaking will eventually dry out your skin.) No bathtub?

These waves go through your skin and break up the stone into small pieces.\nThe doctor might put a tube called a stent into your ureter (urine flows through this from your kidneys to your bladder). This stent helps the pieces of stone pass. SWL takes about an hour. You'll usually go home on the same day.\nAfterward, you'll drink lots of water to flush the stone pieces out in your urine.

If you have this injury, you will notice the patella being out of place and may have difficulty flexing or extending your knee. The doctor will move the patella back into place (reduce the dislocation). Even if the patella goes back into place by itself, it needs to be X-rayed for a fracture. After reducing the dislocation and ensuring the absence of a fracture, the doctors will treat these injuries by splinting the knee to allow the soft tissues around the patella to heal followed by strengthening exercises to keep the patella in line."

The workplace is a common source of exposure to asbestos fibers, as asbestos was widely used in the past for both thermal and acoustic insulation materials. Today, asbestos use is limited or banned in many countries, including the Unites States. Both lung cancer and mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) are associated with exposure to asbestos. Cigarette smoking drastically increases the chance of developing an asbestos-related lung cancer in exposed workers. Asbestos workers who do not smoke have a fivefold greater risk of developing lung cancer than non-smokers, and those asbestos workers who smoke have a risk that is 50 to 90 times greater than non-smokers."

Although macular degeneration is almost never a totally blinding condition, it can lead to a permanent loss of your central vision."

            "What tests diagnose age-related macular degeneration?": "If your doctor thinks you have age-related macular degeneration, you may have more tests.\n\ufffdAngiography. A dye is injected into a vein in your arm, and photographs are taken as the dye reaches your eye and flows through the blood vessels in your retina. If there are new vessels or vessels leaking fluid or blood in the macula, the photographs will show their exact location and type.\n\ufffdOptical coherence tomography shows fluid or blood underneath the retina without using dye."

            "How do anti-angiogenic drugs treat age-related macular degeneration?": "Your doctor injects these medications into your eye. They stop new blood vessels from forming and block the leaking from the abnormal vessels that cause wet macular degeneration.\nSome people who take these drugs have been able to regain vision that they lost. You will likely need to get the treatment repeated on follow-up visits."

            "What tests can determine if I have age-related macular degeneration?": "If your doctor thinks you have age-related macular degeneration, they may want you to have one or both of these exams:\nOptical coherence tomography. It's a special photograph that shows a magnified 3D image of your retina. This method helps your doctor see if your retinal layers are distorted. They can also see if swelling is getting better or worse if you had treatment with injections or laser.\nFluorescein angiography. In this procedure, your doctor injects a dye into a vein in your arm. They take photos as the dye reaches your eye and flows through the blood vessels of the retina. The images will show new vessels or vessels that are leaking fluid or blood in the macula -- a small area at the center of your retina."

            "Are there new treatments for age-related macular degeneration?": "Researchers are studying new treatments for macular degeneration. The following treatments are considered experimental and have been used less often since the development of anti-angiogenic medications have developed:\nSubmacular surgery. Surgery to remove the abnormal blood vessels or blood.\nRetinal translocation. A surgical procedure used to destroy abnormal blood vessels that are located directly under the center of the macula, where a laser beam cannot be placed safely. In the procedure, the macular center is rotated away from the abnormal blood vessels to a healthy area of the retina, thus preventing the formation of scar tissue and further damage to the retina. Once moved away from the abnormal blood vessels, a laser is used to treat the abnormal blood vessels."

As you get older, the muscles don\u2019t work as well, and your scrotum stays in a more slackened position. Combine that with your skin\u2019s natural decline in elasticity, and the sagging gets worse. If you\u2019re over 40, a hydrocele can also make your scrotum sag. It happens when fluid builds up around one or both testicles. Maybe your body makes too much liquid, or perhaps it can\u2019t drain well. It\u2019s generally painless.

This causes the dominant follicle to release its egg from the ovary.\n\ufffdAs the egg is released, it is captured by the fallopian tubes.\n\ufffdThere is an increase in the amount and thickness of mucus produced by the cervix (lower part of the uterus) during this phase. If a woman has unprotected intercourse during this time, this thick mucus captures the man's sperm, nourishes it, and helps it to move towards the egg for fertilization."

One potential problem with using this type of estrogen treatment is that the gel, cream, or spray can rub or wash off before it's been fully absorbed. Always apply it after you bathe or shower. And make sure you let it dry before you put on clothes."

            "What are the effects of spinal compression fractures?": "After a number of small compression fractures, your body begins to show the effects. The strength and shape of the spine can change. You lose height because your spine is shorter."
        },
        {
            "How do compression fractures happen?": "Soft, weakened bones are at the heart of the problem. Compression fractures are usually caused by the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis, especially if you are a woman over age 50 who has been through menopause. When bones are brittle, your vertebrae aren\u2019t strong enough to support your spine in everyday activities. When you bend to lift an object, miss a step, or slip on a carpet, you can put your spinal bones at risk of fracture. Even coughing or sneezing can cause compression fractures if you have severe osteoporosis."

            "What are spinal compression fractures?": "It\u2019s easy to think back pain is just part of getting older. But be careful. If you\u2019re nearing age 60, it may be a sign that you have tiny cracks in the bones called vertebrae that form your spine. When these small hairline fractures add up, they can eventually cause a vertebra to collapse, which is called spinal compression fracture."
        },
        {
            "Are there any drawbacks or side effects of spinal fusion surgery?": "There are drawbacks to spinal fusion surgery. It eliminates the natural movement of two vertebrae, which limits movement. It also puts more stress on the vertebrae next to the fusion, therefore increasing the chance of fracture in those vertebrae. Even after healing is complete, you may need to avoid certain lifting and twisting activities to prevent putting excess stress on the spine."
        },
        {
            "What pain medications are used to treat spinal compression fractures?": "A carefully prescribed \"cocktail\" of pain medications can relieve bone-on-bone, muscle, and nerve pain. If it's prescribed correctly, you can reduce doses of the individual drugs in the cocktail.\nOver-the-counter pain medications -- particularly acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often enough to relieve your pain. Narcotic pain medications and muscle relaxants are often prescribed for short periods of time, due to a risk of addiction. Anti-depressants can also help relieve nerve-related pain."

            "What is kyphoplasty and how is it used to treat spinal compression fractures?": "Kyphoplasty helps correct bone deformity and relieves pain that come with spinal compression fractures. During the procedure:\nA tube is inserted into the damaged vertebrae through a cut in the back.\nA thin catheter tube, tipped with a balloon, is guided into the vertebra.\nThe balloon is inflated to create a cavity in which bone cement will be injected.\nThe balloon is deflated and removed, and the bone cement is injected into the cavity.\nThe cement mixture hardens in about 10 minutes."

        },
        {
            "What kind of diet is good for osteopenia?": "For strong bones, you need a diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. High-calcium foods include dairy products, dark green vegetables, sardines and salmon (with bones), and tofu. Your body makes its own vitamin D when sunlight hits your skin. A few foods naturally have vitamin D. Others, such as grains and dairy foods, are fortified with it.\nCut back on salt and caffeine . Both may make your body lose more calcium and bone.\nHave no more than one drink a day for women, two for men."
        },
        {
            "Why should you limit alcohol if you have osteopenia?": "Too much beer, wine, and liquor can mess with the balance of calcium in your body and change how your body makes hormones and vitamins for healthy bones. Having too much to drink can also make you more likely to fall, which means you could break a bone."
        },

            "Can supplements treat osteopenia?": "You should talk to your doctor before you start taking a supplement. If you aren't getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet and don't spend much time in the sun, you may need to take one.\nOthers may help strengthen bones, but so far, there\u2019s little research showing how well they work:\nBoron\nCopper\nDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)\nFolic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12\nManganese\nOmega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA)\nSilicon\nStrontium\nZinc\nHerbs that might be helpful include:\nBlack cohosh\nHorsetail\nRed clover"

            "How long does it take to recover from spinal fusion surgery?": "Recovery from spinal fusion surgery takes longer than with other types of spinal surgery. Patients often have a 3- or 4-day hospital stay, with a possible stay on a rehabilitation unit. Patients typically wear a brace immediately after surgery. Rehabilitation is often necessary to rebuild strength and functioning. Activity level is gradually increased. Depending on the patient's age and health status, getting back to normal functioning can happen within 2 months, or up to 6 months later."

Keeping the treatment going at that point may draw out the process of dying and may also be costly.\nChoosing to remove life support usually means you'll die within hours or days. The timing depends on what treatment is stopped. People tend to stop breathing and die soon after a ventilator shuts off, though some do start breathing again on their own. If you're not getting in any fluids, you'll likely die within several days of your feeding tube removal. But you may survive for as long as 1 or 2 weeks.\nWhen you're unconscious or not of sound mind, doctors and family members will decide when life support measures should stop. It's a hard decision, especially if you haven't previously discussed your end-of-life wishes with your family. Doctors encourage family members to focus on what they think their loved one would want.\nIt's important to remember that it's the underlying condition, not the removal of life support, that actually causes someone to die, and doctors will do all they can to keep your loved one comfortable."

Most patients can expect to lose weight after the surgery.\nDiabetes. This condition can develop if too many insulin-producing cells are removed from the pancreas. However, patients who have normal blood sugar before surgery are unlikely to develop diabetes, and those who recently developed diabetes before surgery are even likely to improve."

However, cancer specialists have differing opinions on the best combination and the best drugs to use.\nIt's not yet known if therapy works better before or after surgery, but some research suggests that therapy could allow a few patients who are initially thought to be ineligible for surgery to eventually undergo the Whipple procedure. Studies are ongoing."

            "What's the difference between exocrine and endocrine cell cancers?": "In pancreatic cancer, the organ's cells grow abnormally. About 95% of pancreatic cancers are exocrine cell cancers, called adenocarcinoma. These cancers usually start in the head of the pancreas. Endocrine cell cancers -- or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors -- are slower growing tumors with a different prognosis and treatment than pancreatic adenocarcinoma."
        },
        {
            "What are the main risk factors for pancreatic cancer?": "Aside from advanced age, smoking is the main risk factor for pancreatic cancer; a smoker is twice as likely as a nonsmoker to get the disease. People frequently exposed to certain chemical carcinogens may also be at increased risk. Excessive dietary fat and protein as well as low fiber intake may promote the disease. High body mass index (a measure of obesity), increased height, and a low level of physical activity increases the risk as well. Pancreatic cancer is more common in people with diabetes but the link is not fully understood."

            "What is the pancreas?": "The pancreas is an organ located behind your stomach next to the top of the small intestine. It is about six inches long but is less than two inches wide and functions as two separate organs. It has two big manufacturing jobs in the body:\nIt makes digestive juices that help the intestines break down food\nIt produces hormones -- including insulin -- that regulate the body's use of sugars and starches. The pancreas is divided into three sections: the head, the body, and the tail."
        },
        {
            "What age groups are most at risk for pancreatic cancer?": "Pancreatic cancer almost always strikes over the age of 45, with about two-thirds of cases occurring in people over the age of 65. It is slightly more common in men than in women."
        },
        {
            "What is distal pancreatectomy?": "Distal pancreatectomy is a procedure in which the tail and/or portion of the body of the pancreas are removed, but not the head. This surgery is uncommon for pancreatic cancer, because most tumors arising outside the head of the pancreas within the body or tail are unresectable."
        },
        {
            "How can I prevent pancreatic cancer?": "Pancreatic cancer is not easily prevented, but you can take measures to reduce your risk. If you work around certain chemicals, dyes, or pesticides that are known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer, take precautions to avoid unnecessary exposure to both materials and fumes. Cigarette smoking doubles the risk of pancreatic cancer when compared to non-smokers."

            "What is the Whipple procedure?": "The classic Whipple procedure is named after Allen Whipple, MD, a Columbia University surgeon who was the first American to perform the operation in 1935. Also known as pancreaticoduodenectomy, the Whipple procedure involves removal of the \"head\" (wide part) of the pancreas next to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). It also involves removal of the duodenum, a portion of the common bile duct, gallbladder, and sometimes part of the stomach. Afterward, surgeons reconnect the remaining intestine, bile duct, and pancreas."
        },
        {
            "Where should the Whipple procedure be done?": "Because the Whipple procedure continues to be one of the most demanding and risky operations for surgeons and patients, the American Cancer Society says it's best to have the procedure done at a hospital that performs at least 15 to 20 pancreas surgeries per year. The organization also recommends choosing a surgeon who does many such operations."

            "What is it like for patients after the Whipple procedure?": "At first, patients can eat only small amounts of easily digestible food after a Whipple procedure. They may need to take pancreatic enzymes -- either short-term or long-term -- to assist with digestion. Diarrhea is a common problem during the two or three months it usually takes for the rearranged digestive tract to fully recover."

Your doctor will prescribe the best treatment plan for you.\nDopamine agonists: These are most often the first medicines used to treat RLS. These drugs, including pramipexole (Mirapex), rotigotine (Neupro), and ropinirole (Requip), act like the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Side effects include daytime sleepiness, nausea, and lightheadedness.\nDopaminergic agents: These drugs, including Sinemet -- a combination of levodopa and carbidopa -- increase the level of dopamine in the brain and may improve leg sensations in RLS. However, they may cause a worsening of symptoms for some people after daily use. Side effects can also include nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and involuntary movements (dyskinesias).\nBenzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and temazepam (Restoril), are sedatives. They do not so much relieve symptoms as help you sleep through the symptoms.\nOpiates: These drugs are most often used to treat pain, but they can also relieve RLS symptoms. Because opiates are very addictive, they are usually used only when other drugs don't work. Hydrocodone (Vicodin, Norco) is one example.\nAnticonvulsants: These agents, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), may help relieve the symptoms of RLS as well as any chronic pain or nerve pain.\nAlpha2 agonists: These agents stimulate alpha2 receptors in the brain stem. This activates nerve cells (neurons) that \"turn down\" the part of the nervous system that controls muscle involuntary movements and sensations. The drug clonidine (Catapres) is an example."

Common STDs that might cause you to develop a rash on your penis include:\nScabies. These tiny mites burrow under your skin and lay eggs, causing an acne-like rash and fierce itching. You get scabies by having skin-on-skin contact for an extended period of time with someone who has it. That\u2019s why a common way to get it is through sex. The itching can get worse at night. Scratching the area can lead to sores, which can become infected.\nSyphilis. Condyloma lata rash is linked to the secondary stage of this STD. It causes large, raised gray or white lesions on the genitals. You can get it if your penis has direct contact with a syphilis sore (called a chancre) during sex. Chancres don\u2019t itch, so you might not know you have one. Still, syphilis can lead to serious health problems.\nGenital herpes may cause ithcing, pain and sores in your genital area. If you have this diease, you may have no obvious signs or symptoms. You can be contagious even if you have no visible sores. There is no cure for genital herpes.

However, if your thyroid hormone levels are affected--either too high or too low-- you will need treatment.\nTreatment involves getting the thyroid hormone levels back to normal, usually with medication. When the medication takes effect, the thyroid may begin to return to its normal size. However, a large nodular goiter with a lot of internal scar tissue will not shrink with treatment. If the goiter is uncomfortable, causes overproduction of thyroid hormone unresponsive to medications, is large enough that it causes symptoms because of its size, or becomes cancerous, the entire thyroid gland may have to be surgically removed.\nYour doctor may want to reevaluate the goiter on a periodic basis with ultrasound to be sure that it is not growing larger or developing suspicious looking nodules that might require a fine-needle biopsy.\n."
