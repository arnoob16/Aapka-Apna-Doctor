It's unclear whether their deaths were due to the combination of drugs.If you take them together, your doctor should watch you closely to help lower your risk of complications. They can screen you for heart rhythm irregularities, check your blood pressure often, and do electrocardiograms.If your doctor thinks that taking these two medications has more possible benefits than risks, it may be a good option for you."

  utter_faq/similar_ritalin_cocaine:
  - text: "In large doses -- greater than what is typically prescribed for ADHD -- Ritalin does have effects similar to those of cocaine. However, researchers have found marked differences between the two drugs. One of the factors that leads to addiction and drug abuse is how quickly a drug raises dopamine levels. The faster dopamine levels go up, the greater the potential for abuse. One researcher found that Ritalin takes about an hour to raise dopamine levels in the brain, compared to only seconds with inhaled cocaine. The doses of Ritalin and other stimulants used to treat ADHD tend to be lower and longer-acting, which reduces the risk of addiction. Long-term use of all stimulants can sometimes lead to a phenomenon called tolerance -- that is, higher doses are needed to achieve the same effect of a controlled substance. If and when this happens, a doctor may then be more likely to consider using nonstimulant medicines to treat ADHD."

  utter_faq/adderstimulant,_cmake_sopeople_sleepy:

  utter_faq/age_kids_usually_see_doctfoppositional_defiant_disorder:
  - text: "Your doctor will also probably wait until your child is at least 4 to diagnose oppositional defiant disorder. This kind of behavior can be normal at 2 or 3 years old, but it becomes a problem if it continues as your child gets older. Your doctor will want to wait to make a firm diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder until your child’s behavior is more extreme than what is age-appropriate."

  utter_faq/why_sopeople_get_acne_otdon't:
  - text: "It is not clear why some people are more prone to acne than others.The exact cause of acne is not known, but hormones called androgens can play a role. Androgens increase in both boys and girls during puberty. Androgens make the skin's oil glands get larger and make more sebum. Androgens also can increase because of hormonal changes related to pregnancy or starting or stopping birth control pills. Genetics may also matter. If your parents had acne, you may have inherited that tendency."

  utter_faq/tacne-friendly_afterslotions:
  - text: "Men with acne need to pay attention to their skin care regimen, too. Shaving can be both a plus and minus for a man's skin. The plus is that shaving each day acts as a natural exfoliant, opening your pores so the excess oil can drain out. But if you shave the wrong way or use the wrong products, you could wind up with more acne. Or, you could get razor bumps, which aren't acne but look a lot like them. Razor bumps pop up when newly cut, sharp-ended hairs turn back into the skin and make the skin swell up."

  utter_faq/treatments_fagoraphobia:
  - text: "There are many drugs your doctor might suggest for agoraphobia. The most common kinds are antidepressants and anti-anxiety medicines. Doctors often start with a low dose of one of these medicines that raises the level of one of the feel-good chemicals in your brain called serotonin. Some of the medications that help balance serotonin are citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and venlafaxine (Effexor).You'll probably take medicine for at least 6 months to a year. If you feel better and no longer are stressed when you're in places that used to scare you, your doctor may begin tapering off your medicine.Lifestyle changes may also help. Exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet. Skip caffeine and alcohol. They can make your symptoms worse."

  utter_faq/long_panic_attacks_last:
  - text: "Panic attacks are generally brief, lasting less than 10 minutes, although some of the symptoms may persist for a longer time. People who have had one panic attack are more likely to have subsequent panic attacks than those who have never experienced a panic attack. When the attacks occur repeatedly -- and there is worry about having more episodes -- you have a condition known as panic disorder."

  utter_faq/panic_disorder_treated:
  - text: "Fortunately, panic disorder is a treatable condition. Psychotherapy and medications have both been used, either individually or in combination, for successful treatment of panic disorder. If you need medication, your doctor may prescribe anti-anxiety medications, certain anti-depressants or sometimes certain anti-convulsant drugs that can alleviate anxiety. You could also receive a class of heart medications known as beta-blockers to help prevent or control the episodes that comprise panic disorder."

  utter_faq/common_panic_disorder:
  - text: "People with panic disorder may be extremely anxious and fearful, since they are unable to predict when the next episode will occur. Panic disorder is fairly common and affects about 6 million adults in the U.S. Women are twice as likely as men to develop the condition, and its symptoms usually begin in early adulthood."

  utter_faq/causes_panic_disorder:
  - text: "It is not clear what causes panic disorder. In many people who have the biological vulnerability to panic attacks, they may develop in association with major life changes (such as getting married, having a child or starting a first job) and major lifestyle stressors. There is also some evidence that suggests that the tendency to develop panic disorder may run in families. People who suffer from panic disorder are also more likely than others to suffer from depression, attempt suicide, or to abuse alcohol or drugs."

You often feel it in your big toe.Kidney stones. These are little, hard masses -- like small stones -- that form in your kidneys when you have too much uric acid. They may cause severe pain in your lower back that comes and goes, blood in your urine, throwing up, upset stomach, and an urgent need to pee.High uric acid level during chemo or radiation. These treatments kill a lot of cells in your body, which can raise the level of uric acid. The test is used to check and make sure your level doesn’t get too high."

  utter_faq/tfoods_avoid_help_prevent_gout:
  - text: "If gout runs in the family, men in particular should limit alcohol, fats, and foods that are more likely to raise their uric acid level in the body (such as meat, sardines, bacon, mussels, and yeast).

  utter_faq/why_trigger_finger_happen:
  - text: "Trigger finger happens when tendons in the finger or thumb become inflamed. A tendon usually glides easily through the tissue that covers it (called a sheath) because of a lubricating membrane surrounding the joint. Prolonged irritation of the tendon sheath can produce scarring and thickening that get in the way of tendon's motion. When this happens, bending the finger or thumb can pull the inflamed tendon through a narrowed tendon sheath, making it snap or pop."

  utter_faq/symptoms_trigger_finger:
  - text: "One of the first symptoms of trigger finger is soreness at the base of the finger or thumb. The most common symptom is a painful clicking or snapping when bending or straightening the finger. This catching sensation tends to get worse after resting the finger or thumb and loosens up with movement.In some cases, the finger or thumb locks in a bent or straight position as the condition gets worse and must be gently straightened with the other hand."

  utter_faq/pseudogout:
  - text: "Pseudogout is similar to gout but is generally a less painful condition caused by calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints. While it can affect the large toe, it is more commonly seen in larger joints such as the knee, wrist, or ankle. More common after age 60 in both sexes, pseudogout is treated with anti-inflammatory agents."

  utter_faq/causes_trigger_finger:
  - text: "Trigger finger can be caused by a repeated movement or forceful use of the finger or thumb. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and diabetes also can cause trigger finger. So can grasping something, such as a power tool, with a firm grip for a long time."

  utter_faq/trigger_finger_diagnosed:
  - text: "Trigger finger is diagnosed with a physical exam of the hand and fingers. In some cases, the finger may be swollen and there may be a bump over the joint in the palm of the hand. The finger also may be locked in bent position, or it may be stiff and painful. No X-rays or lab tests are used to diagnose trigger finger."

  utter_faq/avascular_necros(avn)_treated_before_surgery:
  - text: "If avascular necrosis is caught early, treatment may involve medications to ease pain or limiting the use of the affected joint. If your hip, knee, or ankle is affected, you may need crutches to take weight off the damaged joint. Your doctor may also recommend range-of-motion exercises to help keep the affected joint moving well. While these may slow the progression of avascular necrosis, most people with the condition still eventually need surgery."

  utter_faq/avascular_necros(avn):
  - text: "Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, or ischemic bone necrosis, is a condition that happens when there's loss of blood to the bone. Because bone is living tissue that needs blood, an interruption to the blood supply causes bone to die. If it's not stopped, this eventually makes the bone collapse.Avascular necrosis most commonly happens in your hip. Other common areas are the shoulder, knees, shoulder, and ankles."

  utter_faq/need_antibiotics_fsinusitis:
  - text: "If a secondary bacterial infection has developed in your sinuses, you'll need antibiotics. Your health care provider will probably prescribe them for about 10 to 14 days. Just remember that antibiotics will only work in cases of bacterial infection. They will not help with viruses. Also, you need to follow your health care provider's instructions and take all your antibiotic medicine, even if you start feeling better after a few days."

  utter_faq/postnasal_drip:
  - text: "Postnasal drip is a lay term that refers to the sensation of thick phlegm in the throat, which can become infected. Your glands in the nose and throat produce mucus continuously (1 to 2 pints per day), that helps to cleanse the nasal membranes, helps warm the air you breathe, and traps inhaled foreign matter. Mucus also helps to fight infection."

You may be given a drug to help you relax before the surgery. Electrocardiogram (EKG) electrodes will be attached to your chest and back to keep track of your heartbeat. You will receive anesthesia to put you to sleep during the surgery. After you are put to sleep, your doctor will connect you to a respirator that has a tube that goes down your throat. This will help you breathe during the operation. You may have a tube inserted into your throat to help collect fluid or air in your stomach during the operation. You may also have a catheter inserted in your bladder to collect urine during the operation. Your surgeon will cut into your chest during your operation, and they will insert instruments to make the small interior cuts or make lesions on your heart tissue. Depending on the type of maze procedure you have, your surgeon may use tiny video cameras or robotic arms to help perform the operation."

As a result, bulging or herniated disks may retract, taking pressure off nerves and other structures in your spine. This helps promote movement of water, oxygen, and nutrient-rich fluids into the disks so they can heal."

Malignant primary brain tumors are cancers that originate in the brain, typically grow faster than benign tumors, and aggressively invade surrounding tissue. Although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs, it can spread to other parts of the brain and central nervous system. Benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually are not deeply rooted in brain tissue. This makes them easier to surgically remove, assuming they are in an area of the brain that can be safely operated on. But even after they've been removed, they can still come back, although benign tumors are less likely to recur than malignant ones."

Arteries and veins in the brain grow in a tangle and become connected by tube-like structures called fistulae. These arteries are not as strong as normal arteries. The veins are often enlarged because of the constant flow of blood directly from the arteries through the fistulae to the veins. These fragile vessels may rupture, leaking blood into the brain. In addition, the brain tissue may not receive enough blood to function properly. Damage to the brain may cause seizures -- the first symptoms of an AVM."

Or you might take pertuzumab (Perjeta) with docetaxel (Taxotere) and trastuzumab. After other treatments, you could take lapatinib (Tykerb). If you took trastuzumab and a class of chemotherapy drugs called taxanes, you may also take ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla).

A doctor called a pathologist will look at your biopsied tissue under a microscope. The structure will tell him or her if the cells are normal, precancerous, or cancerous. If it’s cancer, the doctor will do more tests to figure out the exact kind. If your cells don’t test positive for estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors, then it’s triple-negative.

It depends on the size of your tumor, how quickly your cancer grows, and whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of your body. The treatments may cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, pain, fatigue, or mental fuzziness (which is sometimes called “chemo brain”). Although triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to return to another part of your body than other forms, the risk that this will happen drops over time. Five years after diagnosis, almost 80% of triple-negative breast cancer patients are still alive."

A CDK 4/6 inhibitor such as abemacicib (Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance) or ribociclb (Kisqali) is sometimes given in postmenopausal women with certain types of advanced breast cancer. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) and toremifene (Fareston) block hormone receptors and are sometimes given to women with metastatic breast cancer. These medications can stop this protein from making the cancer grow and can make chemotherapy more effective. Those who are HER2-negative but have BRCA-mutated breast cancer could be treated by a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors that target a protein that helps cancer cells grow. PARP inhibitors include olaparib (Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna). Everolimus (Afinitor) is a targeted therapy sometimes given to women with HER2-negative breast cancer along with the hormone therapy exemestane (Aromasin).Patients who are HER2-negative but have PIK3CA-mutated advanced or metastatic breast cancer could be treated by the new PIK3 inhibitor alpelisib (Piqray) in combination with fulvestrant."

  - text: "The first treatment is usually chemo. If that stops working, your doctor will suggest a different treatment based on a protein your cancer makes. About 20% of triple-negative breast cancers make the protein PD-L1. This protein helps cancer cells hide from the immune system.The immunotherapy drug atezolizumab (Tecentriq) treats triple-negative breast cancer that makes PD-L1. This is a type of drug called a checkpoint inhibitor. It basically takes the brakes off your immune system so that it can kill the cancer cells. Along with Tecentriq, you'll get the chemotherapy drug nabpaclitaxel (Abraxane)."

A low-fiber or low-residue diet reduces the risk of blocks in your intestine and the number and size of your poops. Studies also show a connection between a gluten-free diet and relief of symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which could lower your risk of strictures.Anti-TNF treatment. This medicine eases inflammation from a protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and prevents new strictures from forming. It only works on strictures related to inflammation, not fibrosis.Colonoscopy. Doctors widen the colon with a balloon inserted through a flexible tube (endoscope). They may use a stent to keep the narrowed area open.Your doctor may also suggest surgery. Studies show that most people with Crohn's disease who also have a stricture will need at least one surgery at some point. There are two kinds:Strictureplasty widens the narrow part of your intestine without removing it. This surgery is most helpful in the lower part of your small intestine.Small bowel resection is when the surgeon takes out the damaged part of your intestine, then joins the healthy sections together.

That’s the first place for your vet will look.If it’s time for your dog’s annual check-up, or if you or your vet thinks your dog has worms, provide a fresh stool sample. Simply scoop up some of your pet’s poop, seal it in a clean plastic bag, and bring it to the appointment. If you can't do that, your vet can take a sample during the office visit. They'll check it under a microscope to see if it has worms, and, if so, what kind."

  utter_faq/best_way_diagnose_worm_problem_in_dogs:
  - text: "The best way to diagnose a worm problem is with a visit to the vet. Treatment depends on which type of worm your dog has, but generally includes an oral medication and may require follow-up. Don't try treating worms yourself: A medication that kills roundworms, for example, doesn't kill tapeworms."

It's rare for dogs in the U.S. to have rabies, but if you don't know the dog's health status, or if it tests positive for rabies, you'll need to get a rabies vaccine. (Bear in mind that the dog will have to be euthanized and its brain tested for rabies.) The doctor will also make sure that you're up to date on your tetanus shot."

  utter_faq/types_seizures_in_dogs:
  - text: "The most common kind is the generalized seizure, also called a grand mal seizure. A dog can lose consciousness and convulse. The abnormal electrical activity happens throughout the brain. Generalized seizures usually last from a few seconds to a few minutes. With a focal seizure, abnormal electrical activity happens in only part of the brain. Focal seizures can cause unusual movements in one limb or one side of the body. Sometimes they last only a couple of seconds. They may start as focal and then become generalized. A psychomotor seizure involves strange behavior that only lasts a couple of minutes. Your dog may suddenly start attacking an imaginary object or chasing its tail. It can be tricky to tell psychomotor seizures from odd behavior, but a dog that has them will always do the same thing every time it has a seizure. Seizures from unknown causes are called idiopathic epilepsy. They usually happen in dogs between 6 months and 6 years old. Although any dog can have a seizure, idiopathic epilepsy is more common in border collies, Australian shepherds, Labrador retrievers, beagles, Belgian Tervurens, collies, and German shepherds."

Children get more ear infections than adults because their bodies are still developing.In kids, the parts of the ear that drain fluid, the Eustachian tubes, are smaller and almost level to the ground. That means they don't drain as well even when a young one is healthy.When the Eustachian tubes swell or fill with mucus, perhaps during a cold, it's even worse. It creates just the right conditions for bacteria to thrive, which can lead to infection. And for some kids, it just happens more often."

This typically means removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and might also include lymph nodes in the area.A lab will usually test the tissue the surgeon removes to help figure out the type of cancer and how far it may have spread. The results can help determine whether you need further cancer treatment like radiation or chemotherapy.Because hormones like estrogen are often linked to this cancer, hormone blocking medications also might help."

  utter_faq/symptoms_endometriosendometrial_cancer:

That's because wherever the endometrial tissue develops, it often bleeds along with the lining of your uterus during your monthly period. Blood can build up in the area and cause swelling and pain. This can even scar some of your internal tissue, making it less healthy and flexible and causing still more pain.Other symptoms of endometriosis include painful menstrual cramps in your lower belly or back. You also might have pain during sex or pain when you urinate or have a bowel movement. You could have difficulty getting pregnant or get heavy bleeding, spotting, or bloody urine between periods.You might notice similar symptoms if you have endometrial cancer. Unusual bleeding, for example, whether during or between periods, is common in about 90% of women with the disease. Unusual belly pain and swelling are more common in later stages of this cancer."

Now, however, some doubts are beginning to emerge. Solomon L. Moshe, MD, director of Clinical Neurophysiology and Child Neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, is researching the subject and remains cautious. I don't think it's good to say one way or another whether seizures do long-term damage, he says. I think it all depends on the individual case.

If you miss a dose, you should take it as soon as you remember, unless the time for your next dose is closer. If so, skip the missed dose, and go back to your regular schedule. Never double your dose to catch up."

  utter_faq/fibro_fog:
  - text: "The name says it all: a fuzzy-headed feeling that keeps you from thinking clearly when you have fibromyalgia. You may get distracted, forget or lose things, and struggle to keep up with conversations. Many people feel the fog impacts their lives more than the pain, tenderness, and fatigue. While scientists are learning more about what's happening in your brain that causes the pain and some other symptoms, what's behind fibro fog remains unclear."

  utter_faq/prescription_pain_relievers_chelp_trefibromyalgia:
  - text: "In most cases, opioid painkillers aren't recommended for fibromyalgia. They don't work, and they may even make the pain worse. But for serious cases, your doctor may prescribe tramadol (Ultram). Because tramadol can be addictive, you'll usually only take it for a short period of time. It can also lead to stomach pain, constipation, nausea, and trouble concentrating."

  utter_faq/fatigue_fibromyalgifeel_like:
  - text: "A lingering tiredness and feeling drained is another big complaint associated with fibromyalgia. People often feel tired even when they should feel rested, such as after a good night's sleep. Some say it's like having the flu. Some compare it to working long hours and missing a lot of sleep."

  utter_faq/shin_splints_treated:
  - text: "They often heal on their own, but you can:Rest your body. It needs time to heal.Ice your shin to ease pain and swelling. Do it for 20-30 minutes every 3 to 4 hours for 2 to 3 days, or until the pain is gone.Use insoles or orthotics for your shoes. Shoe inserts -- which can be custom-made or bought off the shelf -- may help if your arches collapse or flatten when you stand up.Take anti-inflammatory painkillers, if you need them. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin, will help with pain and swelling."

  utter_faq/long_take_fdislocated_separated_shoulder_get_better:
  - text: "How quickly you recover depends on how serious your shoulder injury is. Separated shoulders usually take up to six weeks to heal. Dislocated shoulders may take longer, three to 12 weeks. But everyone heals at a different rate. Some symptoms, like stiffness, may linger for a time. A separated shoulder can sometimes leave a permanent, but painless, bump on your shoulder."

  utter_faq/surgery_needed_fseparated_dislocated_shoulder:
  - text: "These are two different injuries that can happen after a fall or a blow. You may need surgery for a separated shoulder if you tear your ligament severely. For a dislocated shoulder, all you may need is to pop the top of your arm bone back into your shoulder socket. But sometimes surgery may be necessary to position the bones right. If you keep dislocating your shoulder, surgery may help by tightening the ligaments surrounding the joint."

  - text: "The ankle joint is made up of 3 bones coming together.The tibia, which is the main bone of the lower leg, makes up the medial, or inside, of the ankle joint. The fibula is a smaller bone that parallels the tibia in the lower leg and makes up the lateral, or outside, of the ankle joint. The far ends of both the tibia and fibula are known as the malleoli (singular is malleolus). Together they form an arch that sits on top of the talus, one of the bones in the foot.These 3 bones (tibia, fibula, and talus) make up the bony elements of the ankle joint"

  utter_faq/price_formula:
  - text: "Protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (known as the PRICE formula) can help the affected muscle.First, remove all constrictive clothing, including jewelry, from the area of the muscle strain. Then:Protect the strained muscle from further injury.Rest the strained muscle.Ice the muscle area (20 minutes every hour while awake). Small ice packs, such as packages of frozen vegetables or water frozen in foam coffee cups, applied to the area may help inflammation.Compression can be gently applied with an Ace or other elastic bandage. Do not wrap tightly.Elevate the injured area to decrease swelling."

  utter_faq/muscle_strain_diagnosed:
  - text: "The doctor will take a medical history and perform a physical exam to see whether the muscle is partially or completely torn. That could involve a much longer healing process, possible surgery, and a more complicated recovery.X-rays or lab tests aren't needed, unless there was a history of trauma or evidence of infection."

  utter_faq/kind_cast_need_ffractured_ankle:
  - text: "After the swelling decreases and you are reexamined, then an orthopedic doctor or your primary care doctor may place a better-fitting cast or splint on the ankle. Depending on the type of fracture, you may be placed in a walking cast, which can bear some weight, or you may still need a non-weight-bearing cast that will require the use of crutches to help you walk."

  utter_faq/cprevent_lactic_acidosis:

  utter_faq/long_bones_take_heal_after_ankle_break:
  - text: "It usually takes at least six weeks for the bones to heal. Your doctor will probably ask you to keep weight off the ankle during that time so the bones can heal in the proper alignment. Ligaments and tendons can take longer to heal after a fracture is fully mended. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full painfree motion and strength after an ankle fracture, although most people are able to resume their normal daily routine within three to four months.After the doctor has determined it is safe for you to start moving your ankle, you may need physical therapy to provide gait training, balance, strengthening, and mobility exercises. The therapist will develop a home program that you can use to regain your previous normal function. It can take several months to return to a normal walking pattern without limping."

Then ask your doctor�s advice if you should keep using a splint.�Do stretching and strengthening exercises if your doctor, physical therapist, or occupational therapist recommends them.Severe wrist sprains may need surgery to repair."

  utter_faq/questions_ydoctmight_ask_about_yinjured_ankle:
  - text: "The doctor will seek a history of the injury and will ask the following. These questions are important because different mechanisms of injury are associated with different fracture patterns.Where does it hurt now?How long ago did your injury happen?Does your knee, shin, or foot hurt also?How did the injury happen?Did your ankle turn in or out?Did you hear a crack or a pop?Were you able to walk immediately after the injury?Can you walk now?Do you have any new numbness or tingling in your leg, ankle, or foot?Have you had previous ankle fractures, sprains, or surgeries?"

  utter_faq/long_take_recover_sprain_strain:
  - text: "It depends on the severity of the injury and can vary from person to person. It may take just a few days for a slight ankle sprain to heal, or it may take months for a knee injury that requires reconstructive surgery.For most mild to moderate sprains and strains, you can expect to regain full mobility within 3 to 8 weeks. More severe injuries can take months for a full recovery."

  utter_faq/causes_sprains:
  - text: "Sprains usually happen whenyou fall, twist, or get hit in a way that forces your body out of its normal position.Think of a runner who goes over a curb and catches their foot, twisting the ankle; or a baseball player who slides into a base and twists their knee.Wrist and thumb sprains are also common, particularly in sports where you can fall and land on an outstretched palm."

  utter_faq/what's_difference_between_sprain_strain:
  - text: "People use the terms almost interchangeably to describe everything from a twisted ankle to a pulled hamstring. But they aren't the same.A sprain is a stretch or tear in a ligament. Ligaments are bands of fibrous tissue that connect bones to bones at your joints.A strain is also a stretch or tear, but it happens in a muscle or a tendon. Tendons link muscles to bones."

Experts don't agree on how much vitamin D you need, but they agree that less than 20 nanograms per milliliter needs treatment.If you don't spend much time in the sun or always are careful to cover your skin (sunscreen inhibits vitamin D production), you should speak to your doctor about taking a vitamin D supplement, particularly if you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency."

  utter_faq/best_foods_efbreakfast:
  - text: "It’s a good idea to have something small within an hour of waking up. Resist that pastry or doughnut, though. Your best bet is a mix of foods with carbohydrates, protein, healthy fats, and fiber. Carbs give you energy right away, and the protein gives you energy later on. Fiber keeps you feeling full.Try a whole-grain cereal, low-fat milk and fruit, or a breakfast smoothie made from low-fat yogurt, fruit, and a teaspoon of bran. Nuts or whole-grain granola bars are also easy options."

The sooner after an outbreak starts, the better the chances of the test being accurate.The more common way to find out whether you've got the virus is through blood tests. They show whether you've been exposed to herpes and whether it's type 1 or type 2. Blood samples look for antibodies your immune system makes against the herpes virus. A positive test for HSV-2 probably means that you have the infection."

  utter_faq/pass_genital_herpes_baby:
  - text: "Pregnant women with genital herpes should be careful -- but not overly worried -- about passing the virus on to the baby.A mother can infect their baby during delivery, often fatally. But if a woman had genital herpes before getting pregnant, or if they are first infected early in pregnancy, the chance that their baby will be infected is very low -- less than 1%. Women with genital herpes are examined carefully for any symptoms before giving bith. If sores or signs that an outbreak is coming show up at the time of delivery, the baby may be delivered by cesarean section (also called a C-section).The risk of infecting the baby is high (30% to 50%) when a woman is newly infected late in pregnancy, however. That's because the mother's immune system has not developed protective antibodies against the virus. Women with an older herpes infection have antibodies against the virus, which help protect the baby. If you are pregnant and think you may have been infected recently, tell your doctor right away."

  utter_faq/ttest_fgenital_herpes:

You can also get a blood test that looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system made when you were infected. HSV-2, the virus that causes genital herpes, almost always infects the genitals, so if you have those antibodies you probably have genital herpes.A blood test that shows antibodies to HSV-1, the virus that causes cold sores, could mean genital or oral herpes. That's because oral herpes, typically caused by HSV-1, can be spread to the genitals during oral sex."

But you can still get genital herpes if you receive oral sex (fellatio, cunnilingus, analingus) from someone with a cold sore on their mouth. You can also get it from someone's genitals if you give them oral sex.If you know your partner has genital herpes, have sex (of any type) only when they have no symptoms.

If this happens, it becomes genital herpes.The virus that typically causes genital herpes (HSV-2) is most often passed by vaginal sex and anal sex. But HSV-2 can pass from one person's genitals to another person's mouth, resulting in oral herpes.HSV-2 can't survive long on a non-living surface, so there's no real chance of getting it from a toilet seat or hot tub."

Don't use one that contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9, however. Nonoxynol-9 can irritate mucous membranes, such as the lining of the vagina. Oil-based lubricants are a no-no, too. They weaken latex, making condoms more likely to break. Even if the friction of intercourse seems to be a trigger for symptoms, it probably won't cause a flare-up every time you have sex."

  utter_faq/causes_gray_hair:
  - text: "Scientists have put a lot of effort into investigating the cause of gray hair, and they believe they've gotten to the root of the problem. Hair gets its color from a pigment called melanin, which is produced by melanocyte cells in the hair follicles.Researchers have discovered that melanocytes endure cumulative damage over the years, which eventually leaves them unable to produce melanin. Studies have cited DNA damage and a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in the follicles as possible causes of this disruption in melanin production. Without melanin, the new hair that grows in has no pigment, which makes it appear gray, white, or silver.Some people start to go gray young -- as early as their teens. When graying begins usually is determined by genes, so if your mother or father became gray early, you may, too"

  utter_faq/hair_transplant_done:
  - text: "You usually have the procedure in the doctor's office. First, the surgeon cleans your scalp and injects medicine to numb the back of your head. Your doctor will choose one of two methods for the transplant: follicular unit strip surgery (FUSS) or follicular unit extraction (FUE). With FUSS, the surgeon removes a 6- to 10-inch strip of skin from the back of your head. They set it aside and sews the scalp closed. This area is immediately hidden by the hair around it. Next, the surgeon’s team divides the strip of removed scalp into 500 to 2,000 tiny grafts, each with an individual hair or just a few hairs. The number and type of graft you get depends on your hair type, quality, color, and the size of the area where you’re getting the transplant. If you’re getting the FUE procedure, the surgeon’s team will shave the back of your scalp. Then, the doctor will remove hair follicles one by one from there. The area heals with small dots, which your existing hair will cover. After that point, both procedures are the same. After they prepare the grafts, the surgeon cleans and numbs the area where the hair will go, creates holes or slits with a scalpel or needle, and delicately places each graft in one of the holes. The surgeon will probably get help from other team members to plant the grafts, too."

Your surgeon will have you wear bandages over your scalp for at least a day or two, and may prescribe an antibiotic or an anti-inflammatory drug for you to take for several days. Most people can return to work two to five days after the operation. Within two to three weeks after surgery, the transplanted hair will fall out, but you should start to see new growth within a few months. Some surgeons prescribe the drug minoxidil to improve hair growth after transplantation, but it’s not clear how well it works."

Among other things, these hormones may have:Made the outside of the vagina (labia majora and the clitoris) a little swollen and prominentCaused a thick, milky discharge in the vaginaMost dramatically, at 2 or 3 days of age, your daughter may have a little bit of bleeding from their vagina. This is perfectly normal; it is caused by the withdrawal of the hormones they were exposed to in the womb. It will be their first and last menstrual period for another decade or so."

  utter_faq/should_worry_about_ybaby's_breathing:
  - text: "Signs of potentially worrisome breathing problems in your baby include a persistently increased rate of breathing (greater than 60 breaths per minute or so) and increased work to breathe. Signs of extra work include:Grunting. The baby makes a little grunting noise at the end of respiration. This serves to try to open blocked airways.Flaring. The baby's nostrils flare during breathing, showing increased effort.Retractions. The muscles in the baby's chest (under the ribs) and neck are visibly seen going in and out much more deeply than usual.Cyanosis. This means the blood has remained blue and has not gotten sufficient oxygen from the lungs (such as with pneumonia). For true cyanosis, the blood all over the body should look blue. Check areas that get a lot of blood flow, such as the lips and the tongue. Sometimes, the hands and feet of newborns turn bluish, but the rest of the body is fine. This is not cyanosis but a common response to changes in temperature.Poor feeding. Respiratory distress is often accompanied by a noticeable decrease in feeding intake.Lethargy. Your baby's energy level may be markedly decreased if they have a significant lung problem.Fever. Most infections of the lung will cause a fever, as well. Always check your baby's temperature when you are concerned."

  utter_faq/causes_whistling_noise_in_baby's_breathing:
  - text: "A small blockage in the nostrils tends to make a whistling noise that clears when you suction it out. Newborn babies breathe out of their noses, not their mouths. This is a good trick, as it allows them to breathe and eat at the same time. However, their little noses have small air passages, so a little bit of mucus or dried milk can make the breathing passage even smaller, causing a whistling noise or occasionally, difficulty moving the air in and out."

Your doctor can diagnose it before or after your child is born.During pregnancy, an ultrasound may show that the baby has a smaller-than-expected head size.After birth, the widest part of your newborn’s head will be measured. Your pediatrician will track the growth and compare it to other kids of the same age and sex. If your child's head measurement falls a certain point below the average, it's considered microcephaly.A head measurement is taken during every checkup until age 2 or 3. If your child has microcephaly, their head will be measured at very doctor visit."

  utter_faq/ferber_method_sleep_training:
  - text: "The Ferber Method is also known as Progressive Watching or Graduated Extinction. The goal is to teach your baby how to sleep on their own and put themselves back to sleep if they wake up during the night. Richard Ferber, MD, director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Children's Hospital Boston, developed this method. He advises parents not to start this training until their baby is at least 5 or 6 months old. Here’s an overview of how it’s done:Put your baby in their crib -- drowsy, but awake. Once you've finished their bedtime routine, leave the room.If your baby cries, wait a few minutes before you check on them. The amount of time you wait depends on you and your baby. You might start waiting somewhere between 1 and 5 minutes.When you re-enter your baby’s room, try to console them. But do not pick them up and do not stay for more than 2-3 minutes, even if they are still crying when you leave. Seeing your face will be enough to assure your baby you're close by so they can eventually fall asleep on their own.If they continue crying, gradually increase the amount of time you wait before going in to check on them again. For instance, if you wait 3 minutes the first time, wait 5 minutes the second time, and 10 minutes each time after that.The next night, wait 5 minutes the first time, 10 minutes the second time, and 12 minutes each time after that.Adopting this method might be difficult during the first few nights. But you’ll likely see improvement in your baby's sleep pattern by day 3 or 4. Most parents see an improvement within a week."

While you lie on a table, a low-pressure pump or a gravity-based reservoir flushes several gallons of water through a small tube inserted into your rectum. After the water is in the colon, the therapist may massage your abdomen. Then you release the water like a regular bowel movement; the process flushes out the fluids and waste. The therapist may repeat the process, and a session may last up to an hour."

And sometimes, a little bit of worrying is helpful if it motivates you to prep for an upcoming situation, like a job interview or a school test. But too much worrying is a real problem. It's harmful when it becomes so irrational that you can’t focus on reality or think clearly. It can even lead to physical symptoms."

  utter_faq/acupressure:
  - text: "Used for thousands of years in China, acupressure is based on the same principles as acupuncture to promote relaxation and wellness and to treat disease. Shiatsu is a Japanese form of acupressure.Traditional Chinese medical theory describes meridians, invisible channels in your body that carry energy called qi (ch'i). They begin at your fingertips and connect to your brain and then an organ or networks of organs to create a communication system. When one of these meridians is blocked or out of balance, you get sick. Acupressure uses specific points along these meridians to help restore balance.Western practitioners may say results come from things like reduced muscle tension, improved circulation, or the release of endorphins, which are natural pain relievers."

  utter_faq/happens_during_accupressure:
  - text: "During an acupressure session, you lie fully clothed on a soft massage table. The practitioner use their fingers, palms, elbows, feet, or special devices to gently press on specific points on your body. This is supposed to restore flow and balance to the life energy flowing through you.A session typically lasts about one hour. You may need several sessions for the best results."

  utter_faq/short-term_(acute)_stress:
  - text: "When you are in a stressful situation, your body launches a physical response. Your nervous system springs into action, releasing hormones that prepare you to either fight or take off. It's called the fight or flight response, and it's why, when you're in a stressful situation, you may notice that your heartbeat speeds up, your breathing gets faster, your muscles tense, and you start to sweat. This kind of stress is short-term and temporary (acute stress), and your body usually recovers quickly from it."

  - text: "You’ll be given a hospital gown to wear. You’ll be asked to remove your clothing from the waist up. A cardiac sonographer will place three electrodes (small, flat, sticky patches) on your chest. The electrodes are attached to an electrocardiography monitor (EKG) that charts your heart's electrical activity. The technician will ask you to lie on your left side on an exam table. They will place a wand (called a sound-wave transducer) on several areas of your chest. The wand will have a small amount of gel on the end. Sounds are part of the Doppler signal. You may or may not hear the sounds during the test. You may be asked to change positions several times so the technician can take pictures of different areas of your heart. You should feel no major discomfort during the test. You may feel coolness from the gel on the transducer and a slight pressure of the transducer on your chest. The test will take about 40 minutes. After the test, you can get dressed and go back to your daily activities."

Fatty foods, chocolate, caffeine, spicy foods, and peppermint can aggravate reflux.Avoid alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and tobacco.Lose weight. Being overweight increases your risk for reflux.Sleep with the head of the bed elevated. Sleeping with your head raised may help prevent the acid in your stomach from flowing up into the esophagus.Don't lie down for three hours after eating.Take all medicines with plenty of water."

  utter_faq/role_hiatal_herniin_gastroesophageal_reflux_disease_(gerd):
  - text: "Some doctors believe a hiatal hernia may weaken the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and increase the risk for gastroesophageal reflux. Hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of the stomach moves up into the chest through a small opening in the diaphragm. (The diaphragm is the muscle separating the abdomen from the chest.) Recent studies show that the opening in the diaphragm helps support the lower end of the esophagus. Many people with a hiatal hernia will not have problems with heartburn or reflux, but having a hiatal hernia may allow stomach contents to reflux more easily into the esophagus.Coughing, vomiting, straining, or sudden physical exertion can cause increased pressure in the abdomen, resulting in hiatal hernia. Obesity and pregnancy also contribute to this condition. Many otherwise healthy people age 50 and over have a small hiatal hernia. Although considered a condition of middle age, hiatal hernias affect people of all ages.Hiatal hernias usually do not require treatment. However, treatment may be necessary if the hernia is in danger of becoming strangulated (twisted in a way that cuts off blood supply) or is complicated by severe GERD or esophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus). The doctor may perform surgery to reduce the size of the hernia or to prevent strangulation."

  utter_faq/acid_reflux_disease_ever_treated_surgery:
  - text: "There are two types of surgical treatment used to relieve symptoms of acid reflux disease if daily use of medication isn't effective.The most recently approved procedure involves surgically placing a ring known as a LINX device around the outside of the lower end of the esophagus. The device helps reflux by preventing stomach content from backing up into the esophagus.Another surgical procedure called fundoplication creates an artificial valve using the top of your stomach. The procedure involves wrapping the upper part of the stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to strengthen it.Talk to your doctor to find out if one of these procedures is for you."

  utter_faq/serious_high_blood_pressure:
  - text: "Early on, you may not notice symptoms of high blood pressure, so you may not be too concerned. However, in the long run high blood pressure can kill you. Normally, your heart beats regularly, pumping blood through the vessels all over your body. As the blood is pushed by the heartbeat, the blood in turn pushes against the sides of your blood vessels. Blood vessels are flexible and can widen or constrict as needed to keep blood flowing well. For a variety of reasons, your blood may begin to push too hard against the blood vessels. This is high blood pressure, which can cause your arteries to become stiff over time. This is how problems begin. High blood pressure can lead to damage of your blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and other organs in your body. Heart disease and stroke, both caused by high blood pressure, are the first and fifth leading causes of death in the U.S. The scary thing about high blood pressure is that you may have it without even knowing it. That's why doctors often call high blood pressure the silent killer. Health care professionals agree: High blood pressure is a big deal."

This price will vary depending on where you live, the amount of medications you're required to take, the number of IVF cycles you undergo, and the amount your insurance company will pay toward the procedure. You should thoroughly investigate your insurance company's coverage of IVF and ask for a written statement of your benefits. Although some states have enacted laws requiring insurance companies to cover at least some of the costs of infertility treatment, many states haven't. Also be aware that some carriers will pay for infertility drugs and monitoring, but not for the cost of IVF or other artificial reproductive technology. The National Infertility Association publishes a booklet called the Infertility Insurance Advisor, which provides tips on reviewing your insurance benefits contract."

  utter_faq/estrogen_progesterone_affect_irritable_bowel_syndrome:
  - text: "Estrogen and progesterone affect irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms in a few ways, from how your intestines work to how much pain you feel. Cells in your gut have things called receptors that let these hormones latch on to them. This suggests that your digestive system is designed to sense and react to them. Here are the main ways they affect IBS:Digestion: They control the smooth muscle in your intestines, which dictates how quickly food travels through your system. In one study, animals took longer to empty their intestines when they received a low dose of the hormones than when they got a higher one. This may explain why low levels of sex hormones can lead to constipation.Pain level: These hormones affect how much your cramps bother you. A dip lowers your pain threshold, in part because estrogen boosts the production of serotonin, a feel-good chemical in your brain. A jump in estrogen can reduce some of the ouch factor, so your bellyaches or cramps don’t hurt as much.Inflammation: Sex hormones can raise levels of inflammation throughout your body. That makes your IBS symptoms worse.Most research has linked estrogen and progesterone with IBS. But scientists have also found that male sex hormones, like testosterone, may protect against the condition. This may be partly why men are less likely to get the disorder."

Low doses of antidepressants may block pain signals to the brain.Anti-anxiety drugs may work if you feel anxious right before your symptoms come on. Your doctor may suggest medicines like clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) to calm you down. They’re usually only given for a short time since they have a higher risk of addiction.Alosetron hydrochloride (Lotronex) is specifically for women with IBS who are not having success with other treatments. It can help relieve stomach pain and diarrhea, but there are potentially serious side effects.Eluxadoline (Viberzi) may help reduce bowel contractions, belly cramps, and diarrhea. It’s also important to note that this is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance. This means, among other things, that you’ll have to have a new prescription from your doctor each time you need it.Rifaximin (Xifaxan) is an antibiotic that can decrease bacterial overgrowth and diarrhea.

It's noninvasive, which means no cuts are made to your skin.During this procedure, you lie on a table. You'll get medicine beforehand to limit any pain or discomfort.The doctor uses an X-ray or ultrasound to find the stone (or stones) in your kidney. Then, they aim high-energy shock waves at your kidney from the outside. These waves go through your skin and break up the stone into small pieces.The doctor might put a tube called a stent into your ureter (urine flows through this from your kidneys to your bladder). This stent helps the pieces of stone pass. SWL takes about an hour. You'll usually go home on the same day.Afterward, you'll drink lots of water to flush the stone pieces out in your urine. You might have to pee through a strainer to catch pieces of the stone so they can test them.SWL removes kidney stones in about half of people who have it. If it doesn't work, you might need to do the procedure again."

Today, asbestos use is limited or banned in many countries, including the Unites States. Both lung cancer and mesothelioma (a type of cancer of the pleura or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) are associated with exposure to asbestos. Cigarette smoking drastically increases the chance of developing an asbestos-related lung cancer in exposed workers.

Somewhere between the ages of 9 and 15, your pituitary gland releases hormones that tell your body to start making testosterone. That starts your puberty. Your testes (testicles), scrotum, penis, and pubic hair all begin to grow. Testosterone levels peak in your late teens to early 20s, and then drop slightly through your 40s. After that, your total testosterone levels may drop only a little."

It’s lined with smooth muscle that contracts and relaxes to pull your testicles close to your body to keep them warm or let them drop away and cool off. As you get older, the muscles don’t work as well, and your scrotum stays in a more slackened position. Combine that with your skin’s natural decline in elasticity, and the sagging gets worse. If you’re over 40, a hydrocele can also make your scrotum sag. It happens when fluid builds up around one or both testicles. Maybe your body makes too much liquid, or perhaps it can’t drain well. It’s generally painless. If you notice swelling or feel any discomfort, see your doctor."

  utter_faq/blood_markers_used_diagnose_rheumatoid_arthrit(ra):
  - text: "Rheumatoid factors are a variety of antibodies that are present in 70% to 90% of people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Rheumatoid factor (RF), however, can be found in people without RA or with other autoimmune disorders. In general, when no rheumatoid factor is present in someone with RA, the course of the disease is less severe.Another test for rheumatoid arthritis that measures levels of antibodies that bind citrulline modified proteins (anti-CCP) is more specific and tends to be elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or in those about to develop rheumatoid arthritis. The presence of anti-CCP antibodies can be used to predict which patients will get more severe rheumatoid arthritis."

The surgeon replaces the surfaces of the thigh bone and shin bone that connects to the knee.Partial knee replacement may be an option if arthritis affects only one side of your knee and you have strong knee ligaments.Kneecap replacement replaces only the under-surface of the kneecap. Total knee replacement surgery has a higher success rate.Complex (or revision) knee replacement is for those with very severe arthritis or who have already had more than one knee replacement surgery."

  utter_faq/different_designs_in_knee_replacement_surgery:
  - text: "Knee replacement surgery, which can take 1 to 2 hours, has become so precise that doctors can choose from a variety of knee designs that suit your height, weight, and activity level. The implants, as they are called, are made from a variety of materials, including metal, ceramic, or plastic. They are built to allow easy movement. Some implants are made just for women to closely match their anatomy.A common artificial knee design replaces the PCL (posterior cruciate ligament), located in the back of the knee. Another replaces the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament). Some artificial knees are designed for partial knee replacement, while others are built to keep the PCL and ACL right where they are."

  utter_faq/why_would_need_knee_replacement_surgery:
  - text: "Osteoarthritis is the main reason why people go for knee replacement surgery. The condition is very common. It happens when cartilage -- the cushion between the knee and the bone joints -- breaks down.Other reasons include:Rheumatoid arthritisStructural problems like bowed legs or “knock-knees”Knee injuriesLoss of blood flow to the knee's bones (a condition called either osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis)."

  utter_faq/osteoarthrittreated:
  - text: "Osteoarthritis is often treated with drugs, exercise, applying heat and cold to the joint, canes and other devices, and keeping a healthy weight. Surgery also is an option.These treatments usually don’t prevent your osteoarthritis from getting worse. So many researchers are focusing on ways to prevent cartilage that cushions the joints from breaking down."

  utter_faq/cartilage:

It’s thought that taking them as nutritional supplements may help repair or rebuild cartilage damage from osteoarthritis. So far, human studies have not found strong proof for that. But the supplements may ease osteoarthritis pain. They are safe to take and are unlikely to have serious side effects."

  utter_faq/chondromalacia:
  - text: "Chondromalacia is a softening of the cartilage under the kneecap (patella). It's a common cause of deep knee pain and stiffness in younger women. While treatment with anti-inflammatory medications, ice packs, and rest can help, you can get long-term relief by doing strengthening exercises for the muscles of the front of the thigh."

  utter_faq/effects_spinal_compression_fractures:

  utter_faq/compression_fractures_happen:
  - text: "Soft, weakened bones are at the heart of the problem. Compression fractures are usually caused by the bone-thinning condition osteoporosis, especially if you are a woman over age 50 who has been through menopause. When bones are brittle, your vertebrae aren’t strong enough to support your spine in everyday activities. When you bend to lift an object, miss a step, or slip on a carpet, you can put your spinal bones at risk of fracture. Even coughing or sneezing can cause compression fractures if you have severe osteoporosis."

  utter_faq/spinal_compression_fractures:
  - text: "It’s easy to think back pain is just part of getting older. But be careful. If you’re nearing age 60, it may be a sign that you have tiny cracks in the bones called vertebrae that form your spine. When these small hairline fractures add up, they can eventually cause a vertebra to collapse, which is called spinal compression fracture."

  utter_faq/tdrawbacks_side_effects_spinal_fusion_surgery:
  - text: "There are drawbacks to spinal fusion surgery. It eliminates the natural movement of two vertebrae, which limits movement. It also puts more stress on the vertebrae next to the fusion, therefore increasing the chance of fracture in those vertebrae. Even after healing is complete, you may need to avoid certain lifting and twisting activities to prevent putting excess stress on the spine."

  utter_faq/pain_medications_used_trespinal_compression_fractures:

If it's prescribed correctly, you can reduce doses of the individual drugs in the cocktail.Over-the-counter pain medications -- particularly acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often enough to relieve your pain. Narcotic pain medications and muscle relaxants are often prescribed for short periods of time, due to a risk of addiction. Anti-depressants can also help relieve nerve-related pain."

  utter_faq/kyphoplasty_used_trespinal_compression_fractures:
  - text: "Kyphoplasty helps correct bone deformity and relieves pain that come with spinal compression fractures. During the procedure:A tube is inserted into the damaged vertebrae through a cut in the back.A thin catheter tube, tipped with a balloon, is guided into the vertebra.The balloon is inflated to create a cavity in which bone cement will be injected.The balloon is deflated and removed, and the bone cement is injected into the cavity.The cement mixture hardens in about 10 minutes."

  utter_faq/medications_treosteopenia:

Wear a rigid brace only with a doctor’s supervision. If you use it for too long, it can weaken your muscles."

  utter_faq/long_take_recover_spinal_fusion_surgery:
  - text: "Recovery from spinal fusion surgery takes longer than with other types of spinal surgery. Patients often have a 3- or 4-day hospital stay, with a possible stay on a rehabilitation unit. Patients typically wear a brace immediately after surgery. Rehabilitation is often necessary to rebuild strength and functioning. Activity level is gradually increased. Depending on the patient's age and health status, getting back to normal functioning can happen within 2 months, or up to 6 months later."

  utter_faq/ovary_removal_surgery_affect_fertility:
  - text: "Younger women considering ovary removal surgery may have concerns about their fertility, or whether or not they can become pregnant.It will depend on your situation. For example, if only one ovary is removed, the remaining ovary will probably still produce estrogen. And you will still have a menstrual cycle and be able to become pregnant.There are other ways to aid your fertility. Make sure you talk to your doctor about all your options."

  utter_faq/long_take_recover_ovary_removal_surgery:
  - text: "Your doctor will give you instructions about your return to an active lifestyle after ovary removal surgery. But, in general, how quickly you can return to normal activities depends on your overall medical condition before surgery, the reason for your surgery, and the way your surgery was done. Most women return to an active life about 6 weeks after surgery. Women who had laparoscopic surgery or robot-assisted surgery generally have quicker recoveries of about 2 weeks."

The timing depends on what treatment is stopped. People tend to stop breathing and die soon after a ventilator shuts off, though some do start breathing again on their own. If you're not getting in any fluids, you'll likely die within several days of your feeding tube removal. But you may survive for as long as 1 or 2 weeks.When you're unconscious or not of sound mind, doctors and family members will decide when life support measures should stop. It's a hard decision, especially if you haven't previously discussed your end-of-life wishes with your family.

This condition can develop if too many insulin-producing cells are removed from the pancreas. However, patients who have normal blood sugar before surgery are unlikely to develop diabetes, and those who recently developed diabetes before surgery are even likely to improve."

  - text: "In pancreatic cancer, the organ's cells grow abnormally. About 95% of pancreatic cancers are exocrine cell cancers, called adenocarcinoma. These cancers usually start in the head of the pancreas. Endocrine cell cancers -- or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors -- are slower growing tumors with a different prognosis and treatment than pancreatic adenocarcinoma."

  utter_faq/main_risk_factors_fpancreatic_cancer:

People frequently exposed to certain chemical carcinogens may also be at increased risk. Excessive dietary fat and protein as well as low fiber intake may promote the disease. High body mass index (a measure of obesity), increased height, and a low level of physical activity increases the risk as well. Pancreatic cancer is more common in people with diabetes but the link is not fully understood."

  utter_faq/pancreas:
  - text: "The pancreas is an organ located behind your stomach next to the top of the small intestine. It is about six inches long but is less than two inches wide and functions as two separate organs. It has two big manufacturing jobs in the body:It makes digestive juices that help the intestines break down foodIt produces hormones -- including insulin -- that regulate the body's use of sugars and starches. The pancreas is divided into three sections: the head, the body, and the tail."

  utter_faq/cprevent_pancreatic_cancer:
  - text: "Pancreatic cancer is not easily prevented, but you can take measures to reduce your risk. If you work around certain chemicals, dyes, or pesticides that are known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer, take precautions to avoid unnecessary exposure to both materials and fumes. Cigarette smoking doubles the risk of pancreatic cancer when compared to non-smokers."

  utter_faq/whipple_procedure:
  - text: "The classic Whipple procedure is named after Allen Whipple, MD, a Columbia University surgeon who was the first American to perform the operation in 1935. Also known as pancreaticoduodenectomy, the Whipple procedure involves removal of the head (wide part) of the pancreas next to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). It also involves removal of the duodenum, a portion of the common bile duct, gallbladder, and sometimes part of the stomach. Afterward, surgeons reconnect the remaining intestine, bile duct, and pancreas."

Your doctor will prescribe the best treatment plan for you.Dopamine agonists: These are most often the first medicines used to treat RLS. These drugs, including pramipexole (Mirapex), rotigotine (Neupro), and ropinirole (Requip), act like the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Side effects include daytime sleepiness, nausea, and lightheadedness.Dopaminergic agents: These drugs, including Sinemet -- a combination of levodopa and carbidopa -- increase the level of dopamine in the brain and may improve leg sensations in RLS. However, they may cause a worsening of symptoms for some people after daily use. Side effects can also include nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and involuntary movements (dyskinesias).Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and temazepam (Restoril), are sedatives. They do not so much relieve symptoms as help you sleep through the symptoms.Opiates: These drugs are most often used to treat pain, but they can also relieve RLS symptoms. Because opiates are very addictive, they are usually used only when other drugs don't work. Hydrocodone (Vicodin, Norco) is one example.Anticonvulsants: These agents, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), may help relieve the symptoms of RLS as well as any chronic pain or nerve pain.Alpha2 agonists: These agents stimulate alpha2 receptors in the brain stem. This activates nerve cells (neurons) that turn down the part of the nervous system that controls muscle involuntary movements and sensations. The drug clonidine (Catapres) is an example."

This drug kills fungus and yeast throughout your body, so you may have minor side effects, such as an upset stomach or headaches, after taking it.

You shouldn’t take fluconazole to treat yeast infections if you're pregnant, because it may cause miscarriage or birth defects."

  utter_faq/treatments_fgoiter:
  - text: "A goiter may require no treatment, especially if it is small and thyroid hormone levels are normal. However, if your thyroid hormone levels are affected--either too high or too low-- you will need treatment.Treatment involves getting the thyroid hormone levels back to normal, usually with medication. When the medication takes effect, the thyroid may begin to return to its normal size. However, a large nodular goiter with a lot of internal scar tissue will not shrink with treatment. If the goiter is uncomfortable, causes overproduction of thyroid hormone unresponsive to medications, is large enough that it causes symptoms because of its size, or becomes cancerous, the entire thyroid gland may have to be surgically removed.Your doctor may want to reevaluate the goiter on a periodic basis with ultrasound to be sure that it is not growing larger or developing suspicious looking nodules that might require a fine-needle biopsy.."

They also believe genes are involved, because many women who get it have family members who have it."
