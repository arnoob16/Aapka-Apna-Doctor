  utter_faq/cmao_inhibitors_help_adhd:
  - text: "Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors are a group of antidepressants that can treat ADHD with some benefit -- but they're rarely used because they sometimes have dangerous side effects and can cause serious problems when you take them with foods and other medications. They may help people if no other medications have worked. Examples include phenelzine (Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate)."

  - text: "Combining a stimulant with a blood pressure medication can be risky: Some children taking both stimulants and clonidine HCL have died. It's unclear whether their deaths were due to the combination of drugs.If you take them together, your doctor should watch you closely to help lower your risk of complications. They can screen you for heart rhythm irregularities, check your blood pressure often, and do electrocardiograms.If your doctor thinks that taking these two medications has more possible benefits than risks, it may be a good option for you."

  utter_faq/similar_ritalin_cocaine:
  - text: "In large doses -- greater than what is typically prescribed for ADHD -- Ritalin does have effects similar to those of cocaine. However, researchers have found marked differences between the two drugs. One of the factors that leads to addiction and drug abuse is how quickly a drug raises dopamine levels. The faster dopamine levels go up, the greater the potential for abuse. One researcher found that Ritalin takes about an hour to raise dopamine levels in the brain, compared to only seconds with inhaled cocaine. The doses of Ritalin and other stimulants used to treat ADHD tend to be lower and longer-acting, which reduces the risk of addiction. Long-term use of all stimulants can sometimes lead to a phenomenon called tolerance -- that is, higher doses are needed to achieve the same effect of a controlled substance. If and when this happens, a doctor may then be more likely to consider using nonstimulant medicines to treat ADHD."

  utter_faq/adderstimulant,_cmake_sopeople_sleepy:
  - text: "Adderall boosts your levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. These are neurotransmitters in your brain that calm and relax you so you can focus better. They also affect sleep in different ways. That may be the reason the drug causes drowsiness in some but not others. In studies, 2% to 4% of kids who took the drug had low energy and sleepiness. For adults, it was 6%."

  utter_faq/external_catheter_help_male_incontinence:

To prevent leaks, it's very important to get the right fit and to follow the instructions from the manufacturer."

  utter_faq/ypenchange_age:
  - text: "Your penis will change in phases over your lifetime. It mostly depends on your testosterone levels. Somewhere between the ages of 9 and 15, your pituitary gland releases hormones that tell your body to start making testosterone. That starts your puberty. Your testes (testicles), scrotum, penis, and pubic hair all begin to grow. Testosterone levels peak in your late teens to early 20s, and then drop slightly through your 40s. After that, your total testosterone levels may drop only a little."

  utter_faq/ytesticles_change_age:
  - text: "The small organs inside your scrotum mostly exist to make sperm. As your testosterone levels fall, sperm production slows and they shrink. If you get hormone replacement therapy, your pituitary gland will stop sending signals to your testes to make testosterone, and they will shrink more."

  utter_faq/yscrotum_change_age:
  - text: "Its job is to manage the temperature of your testes. It’s lined with smooth muscle that contracts and relaxes to pull your testicles close to your body to keep them warm or let them drop away and cool off. As you get older, the muscles don’t work as well, and your scrotum stays in a more slackened position. Combine that with your skin’s natural decline in elasticity, and the sagging gets worse. If you’re over 40, a hydrocele can also make your scrotum sag. It happens when fluid builds up around one or both testicles. Maybe your body makes too much liquid, or perhaps it can’t drain well. It’s generally painless. If you notice swelling or feel any discomfort, see your doctor."
