The piercing hits an area near the vagus nerve, which travels from your brain to multiple organs. It controls some of your body’s hormones. Stimulating this nerve has been a way to treat headaches in the past. Although some people with frequent migraines say the piercing has helped, there are no studies or research to prove that it’s an effective treatment."
